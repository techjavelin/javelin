# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns
- Modular Vue 3 composables and components
- Strict TypeScript usage
- Amplify Gen2 data access
- Sidebar navigation as source of truth
- Centralized routing
- Vite build and Amplify CLI workflows

## Design Patterns & Idioms
- Business logic in `src/composables`
- UI in `src/components`
- Admin dashboard in `src/pages/AdminDashboard.vue`
- Sidebar in `src/components/AdminSidebar.vue`
- Routing in `src/router.ts`
- Amplify Data client with generated types

## Theme Support (Dark/Light)
All UI components and pages support both dark and light themes. Theme switching is seamless and accessible from any page, using CSS variables and modular styles for maintainability.
